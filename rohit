Hi My name is Rohit Sharma
I started playing for India at the Interntational level from 2007. My first ODI was against South Africa in a 3 match series
in England. 
I was about to make my test debut in 2010 against South Africa but my bad luck I suffered an injury a day before the match while playing 
football. 
Then I had to wait for 3 yrs to earn a test cap.It was during the series against WI IN 2013 which was the last series of the great Sachin Tendulkar
I have been a regular member of the limited overs side from quite some time now. 
I am currently deputy to Virat Kohli in the shorter versions
My name is Rohit Sharma. 
I am from Mumbai
